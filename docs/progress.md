      Since early morning tried to setup some simple project that will use Webpack for "compilation".
      Actually, the whole idea to setup a project with Webpack is because I want to have unit tests.
      How come unit tests are related? To use _automatic_ unit test I need to have some structure and
      'build' procedures for the project. As well, I want to use TypeScript. Thus, I simply cannot
      escape from the 'build' concept at all. The project is not only the to train some skills within
      programming but also to train (somewhat) forgotten things as TypeScript and overall Web
      infrastructures.

      The sad thing that I haven't had any success at all. WHY is it so complicated?.. Or what do I
      miss?.. Tons of _somehow_ connected tools. It is really a pain to make something... Maybe I am
      looking it too complicated. In short, need to put concrete targets and understand how to
      progress.

      - The project should have some small HTML containing all needed stuffs

        I.e., it is enough to have a one big emitted "main.js"

      - Only the code should come from outside

        I.e., "main.js" is enough. I don't build some super complicated web site... just a small game
        with just a small functionality. No need to split modules in webpack, etc.

      - The code should be tested

        It does not matter actually where it will be tested. I.e., whether it will be on NodeJS or
        the browser itself. SO... a kind of subset of Unit Testing is enough.
